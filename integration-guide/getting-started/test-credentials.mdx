title: "Get Credentials for API Access"
description: "To begin using EximPe’s Web Checkout and APIs, you need to generate credentials — `client_id`, `client_secret` ."

## Where to Find Your Credentials

Navigate to the **Developer** section of the [EximPe Dashboard](https://merchant.eximpe.com). You’ll find:

- **Client ID**
- **Client Secret**

These are required to authenticate your API calls.

## If You Are a Payment Service Provider (PSP)

If you're a PSP receiving payments on behalf of your merchants:

1. **Add a Merchant**
   - Before you can make API calls on behalf of a merchant, you must first add them.
   - Refer to the [Adding Merchants](./adding-merchants) guide for details.
2. **Activate the Merchant**
   - In **Test Mode**, merchants are activated instantly.
   - In **Live Mode**, merchant activation follows due diligence in compliance with RBI guidelines.
3. **Retrieve the** `merchant_id`\
   Once a merchant is activated, you’ll receive their `merchant_id`, which, along with the `client_id` and `client_secret`, is required to authenticate and validate API requests.

---

When you're ready to go live:

- Toggle to **Live Mode** in the EximPe Dashboard.
- New **production credentials** (`client_id` and `client_secret`) will be generated for secure API usage.
