## Overview

The Upload Invoice endpoint is used to attach required documents to an order after it has been created. This is crucial for compliance and record-keeping. The request must be sent as `multipart/form-data`.

This endpoint allows you to upload a document (like an invoice or air waybill), associated with an existing order.
