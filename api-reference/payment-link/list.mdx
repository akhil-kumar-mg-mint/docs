## Overview

Retrieve a paginated list of all payment links created by your account. This is useful for building a dashboard to track the status of all your shared links.

## Filtering and Pagination

You can use query parameters to paginate through your payment links:

- `page`: The page number to retrieve (default: 1).
- `page_size`: Number of items per page (default: 10).
