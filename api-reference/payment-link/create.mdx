## Overview

The Create Payment Link endpoint allows you to generate a unique URL that you can share with your customers to collect payments. This is ideal for businesses that don't have a full website integration or want to collect payments via chat, email, or SMS.

## Key Features

- **Customizable Expiry**: Set how long the link remains valid.
- **Buyer Information**: Pre-fill buyer details to simplify their checkout experience.
- **Product Details**: Include what the payment is for.
- **Instant Sharing**: Get a link that can be shared immediately.

## Request Parameters

The request body follows the same structure as the [Create Order](/api-reference/order/create) API, but it's specifically optimized for generating shareable links.

### Required Fields
- `amount`: The amount to collect.
- `currency`: Currently supports `INR`.
- `reference_id`: Your internal reference for this payment.
- `buyer`: Customer details (name, email, phone, address).
- `product`: Details of the item or service.
- `invoice`: Invoice number and date.

### Optional Fields
- `expiry_date`: When the link should expire (ISO 8601 format). Defaults to 1 year if not provided.
